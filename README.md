# JS_alarm_clock

### What did I learn in this small project?  

## setInterval

setInterval was the main focus of this mini project. I decided to display the current time in the shape of an alarm clock, the alarm clock can be "switched on" and off with the red button. That only toggles a classList where the display gets toggled to none
